As you can tell, I'm a little attached to them. :)\n* Which would you rather live without forever: red bull, or baguettes?\n* How many instruments can you play? Would you ever write/perform in any other genre outside of EDM, for fun or in a professional capacity?\n* If you could perform any one Beatles song with all four original members (either in a hologram situation or upon the invention of a time machine), what song would you choose? \n* If you could do a whole album of just covers of one band in tribute, which band would you choose to cover (other than the Beatles)?\n\nHave a lovely AMA!!"|,43,Madeon,Music,cpp6p04

Does that mean you have a lot of elements bandpassed heavily to fit within small frequency ranges or do you looked for/make sounds that have low harmonic content to begin with (ie sounds that are mostly just the fundamental frequency)?\n\n* 2 - with projects as complex as yours tend to get, how do you stay organized given how open ended FL\'s playlist is? and more importantly, how do you manage your cpu usage?\n\n* 3 - Is most of your sidechaining all manual volume automation or do you still use some degree of plugin sidechaining?\n\n* 4 - When you say you use a lot of ghost notes where a sound is being routed to a number different tracks, each processed differently, what kind of processing do you do exactly? Is it something like split band processing where you separately process the highs, mids, and lows?\n\nmuch love and many thanks!'|,18,Madeon,Music,cpp813m

If so (or not) how did you (or another engineer) achieve the really high -5 to -6dbfs peaks and RMS around -8 or -7dbfs without sacrificing clarity in the frequency spectrum of your tracks?

It seems you and Porter decided to go in a direction away from the typical 128bpm DJ friendly style. Lately, I have been torn between writing music that is DJ friendly and music that is more emotional and slow tempo such as Porter\'s "Divinity." The thing is, I really want to write in both styles but in your opinion is it possible for a new emerging artist to have two unique styles in their music and still make it big?

The video for the original with you guys all messing around in the studio looks like it was an incredible amount of fun to make.

Listening to the album, a decent number of songs are in the Ab to B major/F to G# minor range (the first four songs, Zephyr, Imperium, Nonsense, Home, not to mention Finale and The City). Do these keys evoke feelings of adventure for you (this is probably why I connect with this album so much)?\n\nAlso, will there be a physical version of Adventure [Deluxe] available for sale?

I find that the mixes are extremely effective for the overall soundscape / vibe of the tracks, but they obviously vary quite a bit from massive pop tracks like You're On and Pay No Mind as far as level, presence and intelligibility of the lyrics. You've publicly stated that you don't really consider yourself a 'singer'. So I guess my question is:\n\n**TLDR:**What was your thought process around mixing your own vocals the record? Does it feel awkward to listen to / mix yourself knowing that your voice is going to be on a final version vs. a demo mix?\n\nPS.

You and Nathan Barnatt first introduced me to electronic music with your Pop Culture Mashup several years back when I was younger. Since then I never paid it much thought, but on my birthday two weeks ago, my friends brought me to an enormous rave and concert in Seattle and it changed the way I listen to music.\n\nI decided to check you out again, and I think I'm in love. You've grown so much since my pubescent mashup love affair, and now I listen to your music more than anybody else's. Your music fills me with confidence and positivity I never thought I had, and I want to believe that it actually changes the way I treat myself and others for the better.\n\nI'm still very, very new to electronic music. I was wondering if you had any other favorite artists I should check out that have inspired you, or worked with you, over the years. I could use some recommendations. Also, what do you think of Above and Beyond? I just saw them in Tacoma and it blew my mind. I'm quickly falling in love with this musical scene.\n\nI have no further questions. I just wanted to thank you for everything, and to say that, if you're never announced for Paradiso this year (fingers so, so crossed), I will be for sure listening to your album all the way there and all the way back."|,1,Madeon,Music,cppalln

I've been wondering how you did the Guitar. is it a live guitar recorded, or do you have a VST you use and could suggest? How did you process the sound?\n2. What exactly do you use to make your snares? \n3. I use FL Studio as well, and I've been producing for about 2 years now. Would you say that locking yourself in the studio for 24 hrs was effective towards your creativity, or did it limit it? I've considered doing similar, and since you've done it before...\n4.

It's interesting how both you, porter, and some other guys in that electro house realm seem to be embracing this lighter indie style and it's sounding great, but I'd be lying to say I don't kind of miss some of the ultra saturated loudness found in your material just 3 years ago..."|,1,Madeon,Music,cpr2irj

1526,304t92,|Hey i'm Madeon, i'm french and I make electronic music ! AMA|,|b"Ugh. I missed it again. Well, I'll still make a post and ask some questions in the hope you'll see this.\nFirst off, i know it's cliched, but I would like to say that I really like your music, and I look up to you, since you're not that much older than me, and i kind of aspire to be like you.\nNow that that's out of the way, here are my questions; \n     \n1) About your music- how/where do you start? I know it's happened countless times that I've opened up Ableton just to stare at a blank project for a while, and give up. How do you come up with new ideas? \n     \n2) What's one thing that you find cool about music in general? Like, for example, I find it cool how new EDM tracks seem to play around with the classic song structure format and still manage to fit well.\n    \n 3) Do you ever listen to your own tracks afterwards, like just when listening to music? If so, which of your tracks would you say is your favorite to listen to?\n\nIf you read this, thanks! I feel like you're a cool dude, and would love to maybe talk music with you or even become friends, if that's possible. Sadly, I live out in the sticks (relatively) and it's difficult to get anywhere that you're touring to, to even meet you in the first place. I know it sounds weird, but I think I'd like to hang out with you some time.\nAnd on a last note, thanks for reading, have a nice day, good luck on your tour/everything, and I hope it doesn't stress/tire you out too much! I'll try to be on time to the next AMA with you. Cheers! :D\n"|,1,Madeon,Music,cprve2o

I thought the album will end up like any EDM albums/tracks out there, but i was wrong. I've never listened to anything like this since Worlds came out. I consider this as electronic and non EDM haha. Well, is there any chance in the future you will colaborate with Daft Punk? Create something amazing with them? I'd love to hear it when its coming.

In the fall of that year, at the age of just 16, he gained popularity for his award-winning remix of The Island by Pendulum which was praised by the likes of Skrillex and Pendulum front-man Rob Swire.\n\n> In 2011, he created a remix for Yelle\'s "Que veux-tu", and then went on to remix deadmau5\'s Raise Your Weapon which was praised by deadmau5 himself on Facebook and other social utilities. In the summer of 2011, a \nYouTube video of his live mashup "Pop Culture" went viral, which combines 39 pop hits into one song. As of November 2012, it has approximately fifteen million hits.\n\n> Leclercq has been featured on 15 Minutes of Fame, a segment of Pete Tong\'s radio show on BBC Radio 1.
