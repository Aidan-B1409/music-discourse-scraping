1,bv2u80,Madeon - All My Friends,I still feel like I'm dreaming coming onto /r/edm and actually seeing a Madeon release..I love the song!,40,"title:""Madeon"" ""All My Friends""",EDM,epkv0zs
2,bv2u80,Madeon - All My Friends,"I really really enjoyed this track. With that said I hope that the whole new album doesn’t stick strictly to this style exclusively 

Also am I the only one that feels like the art work and even style of the track has a heavy SG Lewis influence ?",142,"title:""Madeon"" ""All My Friends""",EDM,epklbkx
3,bv2u80,Madeon - All My Friends,I'm so excited for Madeon to be back! This song's beat is really catchy and can't wait for his new album to be released.,38,"title:""Madeon"" ""All My Friends""",EDM,epkon50
4,bv2u80,Madeon - All My Friends,Very safe single for an artist who hasn’t had any solo tracks come out since 2015. Groovy as hell put-on-anytime kind of track. I’m confident this isn’t what every song will be like on the album but I wouldn’t be surprised if there is more of this than there was in Adventure.,76,"title:""Madeon"" ""All My Friends""",EDM,epkoxpt

37,bv2u80,Madeon - All My Friends,meh.  ok track with horrible pop vocals.  pretty forgettable.  madeon is a super talented producer but his music from Adventure onwards is so... safe and kind of shallow imo wish he would dive a little deeper and make some more interesting stuff.,-3,"title:""Madeon"" ""All My Friends""",EDM,epmd1zd
