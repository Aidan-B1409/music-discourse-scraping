"(59:22)
O Freunde, nicht diese Töne!
Sondern laßt uns angenehmere anstimmen,
und freudenvollere.

Freude!
Freude!

Freude, schöner Götterfunken
Tochter aus Elysium,
Wir betreten feuertrunken,
Himmlische, dein Heiligtum!

Deine Zauber binden wieder
Was die Mode streng geteilt;
Alle Menschen werden Brüder,
Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt.

Wem der große Wurf gelungen,
Eines Freundes Freund zu sein;
Wer ein holdes Weib errungen,
Mische seinen Jubel ein!

Ja, wer auch nur eine Seele
Sein nennt auf dem Erdenrund!
Und wer's nie gekonnt, der stehle
Weinend sich aus diesem Bund!

Freude trinken alle Wesen
An den Brüsten der Natur;
Alle Guten, alle Bösen
Folgen ihrer Rosenspur.

Küsse gab sie uns und Reben,
Einen Freund, geprüft im Tod;
Wollust ward dem Wurm gegeben,
Und der Cherub steht vor Gott.

Froh, wie seine Sonnen fliegen
Durch des Himmels prächt'gen Plan,
Laufet, Brüder, eure Bahn,
Freudig, wie ein Held zum Siegen.

Seid umschlungen, Millionen!
Diesen Kuß der ganzen Welt!
Brüder, über'm Sternenzelt
Muß ein lieber Vater wohnen.
Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen?

Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?
Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt!
Über Sternen muß er wohnen.","Saila Sobriquet","0","6","2019-10-04T12:51:29.000Z","UgzI58eAiNzs7-hubV54AaABAg","None","FALSE","rOjHhS5MtvA"

"The music is absolutely a gift from Heaven, as Beethoven himself asserts. Thank you to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for graciously sharing such a performance, one of the best I've enjoyed lately, and a visual treat as well! Bravissimi! However, I don't know who or what translated from German .... I hope it was a robot. Aside from the huge gaps in the translation flow, probably due to repetition of words? Well .... that's unusual. But then The Creator, to Whom Beethoven dedicates this music in gratitude for the beauty of Creation, is repeatedly referred to using the pronouns he and him without capitalizing the H. Now, I'm not even religious and find that so ..... well, such a faux-pas, for anyone involved with Arts and Culture. Regardless of one's beliefs, it is very disrespectful towards about half the people in the World, or more. And disrespectful towards Beethoven, his work and his music. Most shockingly it went unnoticed! I suggest someone ought to fix it. Thanks again though. I really enjoyed it.","Roberta Maria Atti","0","5","2019-09-18T16:55:41.000Z","UgyZxbNNeh7JcC9bl6J4AaABAg","None","FALSE","rOjHhS5MtvA"

"SOME OF OUR 17 YEAR OLD CITIZENS CAN VOTE IN THE UPCOMING 2020 PRIMARY ELECTIONS.  Most people think that you have to be 18 years of age to vote in ANY political election in the USA.  However, in 25 states now, some of the older 17 year olds can vote in the upcoming presidential primary elections.  The laws state that a 17 year old can vote in the primary election if he will become 18 years old by the November 2020 general election.  In 2020, if you are eligible to vote in the general election, then you  can ALSO vote in the corresponding primary election.  These laws are in only 25 states.  For example, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Maryland, Kentucky, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Colorado all have 17 year olds voting in their primary elections.  If a 17 year old is going to vote in the primary election, then that person MUST REGISTER TO VOTE BEFORE  the primary election.  In 2020, many high school seniors will have the opportunity to vote in the primaries.  For more information, go to Google, and google in ""17 year olds voting in the USA.""  There you will find a complete list of the 25 states.  Let's everyone vote in 2020.","Michael Lipschutz","0","0","2019-09-15T08:36:25.000Z","UgwR-R5iy_ACrfsbZ2B4AaABAg","None","FALSE","rOjHhS5MtvA"

"German original

O Freunde, nicht diese Töne!
Sondern lasst uns angenehmere
anstimmen und freudenvollere.
Freude! Freude!

Freude, schöner Götterfunken
Tochter aus Elysium,
Wir betreten feuertrunken,
Himmlische, dein Heiligtum!
Deine Zauber binden wieder
Was die Mode streng geteilt;
Alle Menschen werden Brüder,
(Schillers Original:
Was der Mode Schwert geteilt;
Bettler werden Fürstenbrüder,)
Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt.

Wem der große Wurf gelungen,
Eines Freundes Freund zu sein;
Wer ein holdes Weib errungen,
Mische seinen Jubel ein!
Ja, wer auch nur eine Seele
Sein nennt auf dem Erdenrund!
Und wer's nie gekonnt, der stehle
Weinend sich aus diesem Bund!

Freude trinken alle Wesen
An den Brüsten der Natur;
Alle Guten, alle Bösen
Folgen ihrer Rosenspur.
Küsse gab sie uns und Reben,
Einen Freund, geprüft im Tod;
Wollust ward dem Wurm gegeben,
Und der Cherub steht vor Gott.

Froh, wie seine Sonnen fliegen
Durch des Himmels prächt'gen Plan,
Laufet, Brüder, eure Bahn,
Freudig, wie ein Held zum Siegen.

Seid umschlungen, Millionen!
Diesen Kuss der ganzen Welt!
Brüder, über'm Sternenzelt
Muss ein lieber Vater wohnen.
Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen?
Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?
Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt!
Über Sternen muss er wohnen.

Finale repeats the words:
Seid umschlungen, Millionen!
Diesen Kuss der ganzen Welt!
Brüder, über'm Sternenzelt
Muss ein lieber Vater wohnen.
Seid umschlungen,
Diesen Kuss der ganzen Welt!
Freude, schöner Götterfunken
Tochter aus Elysium,
Freude, schöner Götterfunken 


English translation

Oh friends, not these tones!
Rather let us sing more
cheerful and more joyful ones.
Joy! Joy!

Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,
Daughter of Elysium,
We approach fire-drunk,
Heavenly One, your shrine.
Your magic reunites
What custom sternly divides;
All people become brothers
(Schiller's original:
What custom's sword separates;
Beggars become princes' brothers)
Where your gentle wing alights.

Whoever succeeds in the great attempt
To be a friend of a friend,
Whoever has won a lovely woman,
Let him add his jubilation!
Yes, whoever calls even one soul
His own on the earth's globe!
And who never has, let him steal,
Weeping, away from this group.

All creatures drink joy
At the breasts of nature;
All the good, all the evil
Follow her roses' trail.
Kisses gave she us, and wine,
A friend, proven unto death;
Pleasure was to the worm granted,
And the cherub stands before God.

Glad, as his suns fly
Through the Heavens' glorious plan,
Run, brothers, your race,
Joyful, as a hero to victory.

Be embraced, you millions!
This kiss for the whole world!
Brothers, beyond the star-canopy
Must a loving Father dwell.
Do you bow down, you millions?
Do you sense the Creator, world?
Seek Him beyond the star-canopy!
Beyond the stars must He dwell.

Finale repeats the words:
Be embraced, ye millions!
This kiss for the whole world!
Brothers, beyond the star-canopy
Must a loving Father dwell.
Be embraced,
This kiss for the whole world!
Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,
Daughter of Elysium,
Joy, beautiful spark of the gods","Raman TRZ","0","1","2019-08-31T05:46:43.000Z","UgwC66ghdzVreqGLAa94AaABAg","None","FALSE","rOjHhS5MtvA"

"Obviamente, no soy ni crítico ni experto. Pero considero que esta interpretación de Muti debe estar entre las mejores jamás realizadas de la Coral. Observad la ejecución del Allegro: medida, firme, emocional; planteando el leit motiv con una energía convincente, sin apresuramientos ni falsos dramatismos. Ni hablemos del Scherzo: Muti despliega una paleta de recursos expresivos de enorme magnitud, logrando que la sinfónica de Chicago (de por sí un conjunto de músicos de alta excelencia) alcance cotas inusitadas de profundidad, energía y texturas; el conjunto se escucha con una potencia y plasticidad contundentes y, al mismo tiempo, es posible escuchar cada timbre individual. El Adagio... el Adagio es una obra de arte: aquí podemos comprobar la exquisita sensibilidad y gusto de Muti. Sus manos se ralentizan y trazan arcos expresivos más amplios pero increíblemente puntuales, sobre todo en los momentos de mayor lirismo, acompañando apenas con breves expresiones faciales; Muti, que debe conocer indudablemente la Coral de memoria, despliega ante sí, no obstante, la partitura completa de la obra. Acaso afirmando su enfoque literalista y objetivo del Op. 125 del Maestro, a despecho de la enorme emotividad y expresividad de su interpretación; impronta de su acendrada tendencia al virtuosismo. Pero acaso sólo Muti podía ser el virtuoso neo-romántico que extrajera objetívamente de la Coral tan compleja densidad de sensaciones... ¿Las que imaginó, tal vez, el Maestro sordo...? Y el Recitativo, claro... Aquí, un Muti inspiradísimo conduce a la Chicago a una clímax sin precedentes: la potencia del apoteótico movimiento final de la Coral surge, inmaculada, tal vez con el lirismo, la emotividad y la contundencia, que el propio Beethoven hubiese deseado oír. En suma, una ejecución perfecta, de principio a fin. Todo esto, por cierto, gracias al esfuerzo y los dones de un director inspirado, casi en estado de gracia, y un conjunto orquestal, además de los cantantes solistas y el coro, tan finos y perfectos, como poderosos. No sé qué piensan ustedes...","hernanm6","0","1","2019-08-29T23:58:35.000Z","UgxE7IrfekFpkQbebJB4AaABAg","None","FALSE","rOjHhS5MtvA"

"Indeed, but each of these virtuoso musicians are on the path they chose freely for the joy of music. They followed their bliss and it brought them to this place. You can see they truly enjoy what they do, and respect each other's virtuosity. Maestro Muti has them so well prepared that he also is obviously enjoying the fruits of his work with them, respects them, and clearly allows their individual genius to shine through. This work does represent the apex of Western Civilization and the Enlightenment Period, with Schiller's poem set to the music of the 4th movement, in which the highest ideals of kindness and beauty are celebrated. Be so grateful you can appreciate and recognize all this for what it is. Kudos to everyone involved in this : the soloists, and the chorus ... bravo !","dorianmodify","0","3","2019-10-05T13:36:16.000Z","UgyvcClIKE_Gb-8MJXp4AaABAg.9-alUHVJKBa9-hlR2ZkTn_","UgyvcClIKE_Gb-8MJXp4AaABAg","Frisky Bottomsuuater","rOjHhS5MtvA"

"Bernstein's Personal life
After much personal struggle and a turbulent on-off engagement, Bernstein married actress Felicia Cohn Montealegre on September 10, 1951. One suggestion is that he chose to marry partly to dispel rumors about his private life to help secure a major conducting appointment, following advice from his mentor Dimitri Mitropoulos about the conservative nature of orchestra boards. In a book released in October 2013, The Leonard Bernstein Letters, his wife acknowledges his homosexuality. Felicia writes: ""you are a homosexual and may never changeyou don't admit to the possibility of a double life, but if your peace of mind, your health, your whole nervous system depend on a certain sexual pattern what can you do?"" Arthur Laurents (Bernstein's collaborator in West Side Story) said that Bernstein was ""a gay man who got married. He wasn't conflicted about it at all. He was just gay."" Shirley Rhoades Perle, another friend of Bernstein, said that she thought ""he required men sexually and women emotionally."" But the early years of his marriage seem to have been happy, and no one has suggested Bernstein and his wife did not love each other. They had three children, Jamie, Alexander, and Nina. There are reports, though, that Bernstein did sometimes have brief extramarital liaisons with young men, which several family friends have said his wife knew about. 
A major period of upheaval in Bernstein's personal life began in 1976 when he decided that he could no longer conceal his homosexuality and he left his wife Felicia for a period to live with the musical director of the classical music radio station KKHI-FM in San Francisco, Tom Cothran. The next year Felicia was diagnosed with lung cancer and eventually Bernstein moved back in with her and cared for her until she died on June 16, 1978. Bernstein is reported to have often spoken of his terrible guilt over his wife's death. Most biographies of Bernstein state that his lifestyle became more excessive and his personal behavior sometimes more reckless and crude after her death. However, his public standing and many of his close friendships appear to have remained unaffected, and he resumed his busy schedule of musical activity.
Death and legacy
Bernstein announced his retirement from conducting on October 9, 1990,[49] and died at his apartment at The Dakota of a heart attack five days later, brought on by mesothelioma. He was 72 years old. A longtime heavy smoker, he had emphysema from his mid-50s. On the day of his funeral procession through the streets of Manhattan, construction workers removed their hats and waved, calling out ""Goodbye, Lenny."" Bernstein is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York, next to his wife and with a copy of Mahler's Fifth Symphony lying across his heart. On August 25, 2018 (his 100th birthday), he was honored with a Google Doodle.","SuperDiver57","0","0","2019-06-19T08:14:23.000Z","UgwtuzvTMvP0lOeZp5l4AaABAg","None","FALSE","IInG5nY_wrU"

The words so comforting so bright so breathtaking.  And then there is the man who wrote this. 
This particular performance must be just as phenomenal just as moving as the very first time it was performed. Then, of course, there is the Conductor who masterfully and enthusiastically draws out of his performers their absolute best and weaves it like a fine handmade Persian rug mesmerizing all who are either there or see this.

"As this celebration went, it was not really only about the music, notwithstanding the symphonic presence of Beethoven, and the myriad of outstanding performers along with the Great Leonard Bernstein. It was about the call and outcome of reunification of the land and realm of Germany, that though split and separated for so many years under political and war outcomes, kept its peoples united by their history, their culture, and above all, by the eternal presence of their inmortal composers and the superb fruit of their art. At the end of all the playing and the singing and conducting of such sublime symphony, the human reaction and ""Joy"" displayed by performers and the crowds, clearly showed and demonstrated what the whole magnificent thing was all about.","Washington S.

"I saw Bernstein conduct an orchestra on TV in the late '50's or early '60's.  He took, I believe, a sabbatical in the late '70's or 1980, at Indiana University, Bloomington, IN.  I was there, though I never saw him.  I didn't know enough to appreciate him then, but still, I wondered why the students didn't like him and why they thought he was an imposition on them. They were glad when he left.  Even the music school students didn't like him.  They were forerunners of the jerks that most 'students' are today, and successors of the 'student' hippy jerks of the '60's.  Student jerks, all products of the indoctrination establishment from nursery school on up thru post doc.  But now, I know how great Bernstein was.

"Kiara, THANK YOU for listing the timings here !
Do you know, as generous as those many minutes of applause afforded us,
I understand that this applause went on for HALF AN HOUR?!?

For a time I enjoyed an Online correspondence with Oboist Sherry Sylar,
who not only played in the performance you see here but still
plays today in the New York Philharmonic. 

She is the one who told me about the half hour thing and how
EMOTIONAL Lenny and that audience were! 
Sherry stated, it was a very cold day in Berlin that day.
I also learned from her, Lenny was not going to do the Work
until that Wall was DOWN !

"WOW, John...so well put...THANK YOU !  :) 
Lenny F-E-L-T the music, as if by conducting the Work,
he were COMPOSING it !  The chief Actor, the Audience,
picks up on this!!!  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jon, as an added thought to this Beethoven euphoria here,
as you probably know, Lenny was perhaps Mahler's 
greatest exponent. Talk about two PASSIONATE men, 
who conducted several orchestras in common!!!

A memorable performance of Mahler's Second Symphony,
""Resurrection"", was under his baton in 1973 
at Ely Cathedral with the London Symphony.
it's somewhere on You Tube. 

Janet Baker did a SUPERB job on ""Urlicht"".

The very opening of the Work uses Strings attacks,
the likes of which I've not often heard.

The end shows the PASSIONATE Lenny, as if he were
screen testing for ""The Lion King"", 
when 'Simba' took over Pride Rock !!!  :) 
Here are the final few minutes of the Work.

"The recapitulation in the first movement is crazy. I've never heard it sound like that before. Not sure if I would have conducted it like that myself but it's definitely very different. This way, you definitely get a greater sense of the rhythmic drive in that section. Usually, the recapitulation sounds wrathful, hulking and titanic. Here, it seems more vigorous, more athletic. Burning fire rather than the usual blinding light.","Anarcho Platonist","0","0","2017-10-17T05:16:55.000Z","UgzPZ5-L6RCMgOrCAPR4AaABAg","None","FALSE","JCqOHFvO3po"

Buh!

But next guess what.

Should tell you that there could be a couple of people around here possibly pretending to be at least ""numbermaniacs"",
or if not even worse, when it comes to such a thing.

Next the fact that science could be the thing making the possible difference between the genius and the idiot.

Why so, or perhaps not so?

is it perhaps because you could make my things in a given context and next think I am perhaps right, or perhaps wrong?

Right now at Sympony no. 9 (Full) by Ludwig van Beethoven and is this next perhaps supposed to be ""Eine kleine Nachtmusic""?

Perhaps not so, but if perhaps so, should it ""perhaps"" be about be about a given feeling, or perhaps notion?

"Getting to perform this in September as a member of Canterbury Voices as a guest of the Oklahoma City Philharmonic. Doing my research, I like this recording very much. It's very stable and clear. I think one of the biggest challenges of performing this, like doing Handel's Messiah, is trying to undo decades and sometimes centuries of goofing with the piece. People become sentimental about terrible additions for the sake of drama. I'll bet there are about 10,000 published arrangements of the final movement. They do a terrible disservice to the piece. What Beethoven wrote is extreme enough, in my opinion.","David McDonald","0","1","2018-03-27T01:39:25.000Z","Ugys9r3JDNwg2Hs78Zx4AaABAg","None","FALSE","Mz8P8D8MdNU"

"The Unique Story of Beethovens Ninth Symphony
Posted on August 2, 2012 by David Nelson
A grand performance of a new work is how a prominent Viennese musical newspaper announced a concert of music by Beethoven. Another paper wrote that anyone whose heart beats warmly for greatness and beauty will surely be present.

It was on May 7, 1824 that Beethovens Ninth Symphony was first performed. The symphony was remarkable for several reasons. It was longer and more complex than any symphony to date and required a larger orchestra. But the most unique feature of The Ninth was that Beethoven included chorus and vocal soloists in the final movement. He was the first major composer to do this in a symphony.

Beethoven actually started thinking about setting Friedrich Schillers Ode to Joy poem to music as early as 1793 when he was 22 years old. Over the following years, the composer would return to this text occasionally and sketch some possible themes for it, but no music was completed. Of course, the Ode to Joy has become one of the most recognized melodies in all of music

A Choral Finale


Laimgrubengasse 22 was one the three places Beethoven lived while composing the Ninth Symphony.
In 1817, the Philharmonic Society of London commissioned Beethoven to write a symphony, but he did not start serious work on the new piece until 1822. The first three movements were for the orchestra alone, but the composer knew he needed to end the work with something special. This is when he recalled Schillers Ode to Joy poem. A movement based on this famous melody was exactly the ending his new symphony needed.

Although it was commissioned by an organization in London, influential Viennese citizens convinced Beethoven to present the first performance in Vienna. The orchestra of the Kärnnertor Theater had to be supplemented with additional musicians, and a chorus of 90 was needed to balance the strength of the orchestra.

Jumping Around Like a Madman

By 1824, Beethoven was almost entirely deaf, but still wanted to be part of the performance and was on stage while the piece was performed to indicate the tempos. Yet, Beethoven could not resist helping the musicians on stage by showing them the style and dynamics that he wanted.


The Kaerntnertor Theater in Vienna was where Beethovens Ninth was performed for the first time. The theater no longer exists. Today, on the site of the old theater is the Hotel Sacher, right behind the Vienna State Opera House.
The great composers actions were animated to say the least. One musician wrote, he stood in front of the conductors stand and threw himself back and forth like a madman. At one moment he stretched to his full height, at the next he crouched down to the floor. He flailed about with his hands and feet as though he wanted to play all the instruments and sing all the chorus parts. It was a good thing that the conductor had already instructed the musicians not to pay attention to the composer!

Unable to Hear the Applause

Beethovens deafness created one of the most touching stories in music. When the symphony was completed, he remained facing the orchestra and could not hear the thunderous applause of the audience for his new symphony. Caroline Unger, the mezzo-soprano soloist, had to tap the deaf composers arm and have him turn around so that he could see how the crowds response. Many of those in attendance, including Miss Unger, had tears in their eyes when they realized the extent of Beethovens deafness.","Mike Krieger","0","2","2016-12-20T16:17:24.000Z","UgizLqxX8o6Oc3gCoAEC.8LXOA9qJr6T8MiCqcPRDgW","UgizLqxX8o6Oc3gCoAEC","Fernando Alvarado","Mz8P8D8MdNU"

"I guess I should elaborate.  One key to judging a performance of Beethoven's Ninth is the third movement.  Does it hang together structurally?  Are the sonorities balanced?  It's a long and difficult musical meditation, and most conductors get lost in it.  It's an agonizing transition from one kind of music, represented by the conventional, if awesome, first and second movements, which Beethoven thinks he has now exhausted, to an entirely new kind of music, as the male solo goes on to state explicitly.  So it's kinda crucial not to mess it up.  And Wand's third movement is about as convincing as any I have ever heard.","GoldinDr","0","7","2015-01-19T03:44:28.000Z","UgjnyHk2ldxZLXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-83_-70TtaX22g0H","UgjnyHk2ldxZLXgCoAEC","GoldinDr","Mz8P8D8MdNU"

"@RepellentJeff Yet another reply to all other comments. It's not only one of the greatest achievements of all humankind, in every scientific or artistic aspect. Remember that other great compositions like Bach 's  St. Mathew Passion are also incomensurable, but one great difference here is that almost every person I know, even the non interested in classical music, they like and enjoy the final movement, the Ode to Joy theme, and they can feel its grandeur without any bound. In this context, the symphony achieves its supreme goal: to reunite the whole humankind again in a climax of Freedom, of Happines, of spiritual uplift, of forgiving and fraternity. That simple and supreme idea put into music and then fulfilling every human heart.","Francisco Alberto Rodríguez Mayol","0","9","2015-05-07T15:43:11.000Z","UgjdpE4X2lxM0HgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-BIIH7CeA12r4USi","UgjdpE4X2lxM0HgCoAEC","RepellentJeff","Mz8P8D8MdNU"

Her singing was often wobbly, strident and off-pitch, but when she was in form, it was a gorgeous, warm, all-enveloping sound. She was a very generous singer, and always gave 110%.

"Yeah, it seems that way at first, but it's actually more complex. What conductors do is set the beat and amplify certain pieces of the work or instruments. Some conductors prefer works to be played slowly and place emphasis on strings, horns, etc. Bernstein, for example, prefers fast-paced and, it seems from the second movement, amplified percussion. Conductors spend lots of time studying the sheet music then instruct the orchestra on how to perform their specific interpretation. Compare Bernstein to someone else, and you'll see a huge difference in the how the music is played!","Jenny Beldin","0","3","2017-10-06T22:15:09.000Z","Ugh5bKJMN82OtHgCoAEC.8NepP5PZfgf8YO_JZlTX9L","Ugh5bKJMN82OtHgCoAEC","Braddish V","yoH_h6yxgiI"

"El genio de Ludwig, sumado a todo su dolor y el conjunto de frustraciones que vivió, le permitió, en sordera total, componer una obra sin precedentes en la historia de la música. La profundidad de la melodía, la complejidad de la armonía, la elegancia de la polifonía y la imponencia majestuosa de los coros son la expresión de lo que un ser hombre puede hacer cuando conecta con las Musas y escucha la Música de las Esferas de la que tanto habló Pitágoras de Samos. Cuando Mozart conoció a Beethoven (el primero con más de 30 años y el segundo con al rededor de 17), expresó gran admiración por la capacidad del joven para improvisar, hasta el punto que llegó a decir que 'Ni él mismo podía improvisar de esa manera' y que 'El mundo sabría de él en un futuro'. Haydn, quién fue su profesor de composición, manifestó sentirse superado rápidamente por el genio de su pupilo. Schubert, Verdi, Mendelssohn, Brahms, Rossini, Lizt, Chopin, entre otros genios de la música, profesaban una admiración profunda por el genial sordo alemán que transformó la música de su época. Wagner contó que se desmayó y decidió ser músico después de escuchar la Novena Sinfonía . Dios tenga a Ludwig en su santa gloria. Nuestra deuda estética con él es impagable.","Leyder Lasprilla","0","0","2019-03-04T16:25:23.000Z","Uggw3UFio7yr7ngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-38Tq8s3SsZs-h0R","Uggw3UFio7yr7ngCoAEC","Yolanda pinto cebrian","yoH_h6yxgiI"

"For me, von Karajan interpretation with the Philarmonia orchestra, Chor der  Gessellchaft der Musikfreunde Wien, Elizabeth Schwartzkopf, Häfliger, et. al., recorded in Wien 1955, is the paradigmatic version of Beethoven 9th. The reason is very simple and has nothing to do with musical arcana or technical niceties. This was the first record of the ninth I could buy as a medical student during the early sixties. I heard it I do not know how many times. So THIS version of the 9th became for me THE version of the 9th. I admit the arbitrariness of my decision. One thing that I started thinking from this record   was the problem of the transition from silence to music; I believe the 9th first movement offers a magistral answer to the problem  From the darkness of total silence soft, almost inaudible, gradually increasing sounds that grow until becoming the full blast initial melody. The 4th movement offers the alternative: from total silence to a full blast orchestra tutti. The three initial movements offers so much richness, emotion and beauty has has been overcome by the overplayed 4th movement. Thanks for letting me enjoy for the nth time this wonderful piece of music.","Jorge Urzua Urzua","0","0","2019-05-11T23:32:26.000Z","Ugzmim8mTzilWtMQiFR4AaABAg","None","FALSE","fRZaX6-dsn8"

Most conductors try to dramatize what is already dramatic music. They either slow down or try to do something with the music where nothing is necessary. Karajan performs without drama, strict tempo and dynamics.
